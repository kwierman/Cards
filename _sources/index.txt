Introduction
============
At some point, the question was asked: "How many shuffles does it take to randomize a deck?" Well, I'd hate to figure this on out by hand, so Python is going to have to do it for us.

Definitions
=================
First of all, we're going to have to define some the quantities involved.


The primary packages to be used are:
  - :py:class:`Cards.Card`
    - This defines a card as an object with a class and a rank.
    - Example: 
  - :py:class:`Cards.Deck`
    - Deck class definitions
  - :py:class:`Cards.Shuffle`
    - Shuffling algorithms
  - :py:class:`Cards.Randomizer`
    - Randomization routines
